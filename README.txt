To re-run the notebook "Exps.ipynb", it is highly recommended to open it with Colab. 

On Colab, please head to "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type" ->"Hardware accelerator" -> "GPU", as it will be significantly faster. Then Select "Runtime" -> "Run all".

For any other issue when running the notebook, please feel free to contact dawei.x@wustl.edu
