# CSE543T

### Overview

This repository contains report and code for my comparative project **A Study of Algorithmic Recourse** as part of `CSE 543T: Algorithms for Nonlinear Optimization` taught by [Dr. Yixin Chen](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Yixin-Chen.html). 

We appreciate that the python libriry [ReLax](https://github.com/BirkhoffG/jax-relax) supports fast, light-weight evaluation. 

This report involves the evaluation of the following three algorithmic recourse methods:
* `Wachter et al.` Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, and Chris Russell. Counterfactual explanations without opening the black box: Automated decisions and the gdpr. *Harvard Journal of Law & Technology*, 31:841, 2017-2018.
* `DiCE` Ramaravind K Mothilal, Amit Sharma, and Chenhao Tan. Explaining machine learning classifiers through diverse counterfactual explanations. In *Proceedings of the 2020 conference on fairness, accountability, and transparency*, pages 607–617, 2020.
* `ProtoCF` Arnaud Van Looveren and Janis Klaise. Interpretable counterfactual explanations guided by prototypes. In *Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Research Track: European Conference, ECML PKDD 2021, Bilbao, Spain, September 13–17, 2021, Proceedings, Part II 21*, pages 650–665. Springer, 2021.


### For Colab New Users:
To run the notebook [Exps.ipynb](./Exps.ipynb), it is highly recommended to open it with Colab. 

On Colab, please head to `Runtime` &rarr; `Change runtime type` &rarr; `Hardware accelerator` &rarr; `GPU`, as it will be significantly faster. Then `Runtime` &rarr; `Run all`.
